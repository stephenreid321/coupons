# Practical Application Assignment 5.1: Will the Customer Accept the Coupon?

For my independent investigation, I investigated coupons for coffee houses.

As a sense check, I verified that people that regularly drink coffee anyway are more likely to use coffee coupons.

I then investigated the use of coffee coupons across occupations, and found that people working in Healthcare Practitioners & Technical and Building & Grounds Cleaning & Maintenance are most likely to use coffee coupons.

Some other notable groups of people likely to accept coffee coupons include:

* People with no urgent destination (vs those travelling to work or home)
* People who receive a coupon with a 1d expiry (vs 2h)
* People under 21 (vs all other age groups)
* People closer than 25 minutes from the venue
